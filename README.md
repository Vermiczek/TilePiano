Project uses:
TypeScript, React, Howler, FramerMotion, styled-components. 

App that allows you to play a virtual piano. I've made this project just to see whether I am able to use my React knowledge to make a bit more complicated applications. I'm not claiming that it's particularly advanced, but it definitely took some work to figure it all out. I've made the icons myself using InkScape. I know that the useContext is a bit of an abomination and I should've used useReducer insteade of many useStates, but they slowly piled up and by the time I realize that it's becoming a bit ugly the project was finished... So I just left it at that so I can see what mistakes I've made in the past aand I'm a too lazy to fix it considering that I'm not going to keep developing this project.
